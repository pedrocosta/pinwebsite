[^1]: the monster within - in my heart lives a monster - this monster makes me feel depressed - my head tells me to feel good - the monster growls - he wants to eat my brain to get stronger - my head growls - it also wants to eat and wants to kill the monster - for the monster I am scary (at the same time, I fear him) - I devour him (at the same time, he is eating me) - he is not so strong - he could not eat my happiness - I only hear him fadedly - but he still lives on me - my wish is never to feed him

[^2]: the monster within - in my heart lives a monster - this monster makes me feel depressed - my head tells me to feel good - the monster growls - he wants to eat my brain to get stronger - my head growls - it also wants to eat and wants to kill the monster - the monster scares me (at the same time, he fears me) - I feed him (at the same time, I am eating him)  - he is so strong - he is eating my happiness - I can't hear my laughs - I only ear the monster - why do I feed him?
